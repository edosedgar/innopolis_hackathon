# Disc-type glass insulators absence detection (NeuroEye)

Team members: Edgar Kaziakhmedov, Denis Koposov

Source code containing part for data manipulation in **scripts** fodler.

Part used for Yolov8x training is in **network** folder.

## Preface and objective

The reliability of electrical networks depends on the presence and condition of insulators. The objective is to create algorithms capable of automatically detecting cases where the glass insulator is missing in the strings of disc-type insulators based on RGB images.

## Approach

We trained YoloV8x and did this and that (mention tile approach if it works out)

## Data collection

The most important part is data collection. We gathered data from many sources (list them) and did this and that.
